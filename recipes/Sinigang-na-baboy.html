    <h3 class="title">Description</h3>

    <p class="text">Sinigang is a classic Filipino soup characterized by its sour and savory medley of flavors. Its popular comfort food in the Philippines,  usually served on its own or paired with steamed rice on rainy days to ward off the cold.</p>

    <p class="text">Like adobo, the term sinigang describes more a cooking method than a particular dish as it comes with many variations. It can be made with protein such as pork, fish, shrimp, beef, and chicken and souring agents such as tamarind, guava, green mango, calamansi, kamias, batuan, santol, and other native fruits.</p>
